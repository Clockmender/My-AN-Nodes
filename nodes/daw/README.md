**Clockworx DAW Functions**

These nodes use AudaSpace Python API, supplied as part of Blender and have been tested on the Blender 2.8 release dated 04/May/2019. I see no reason at the moment why they will not work on later versions, they will NOT work on previous versions due to additional functions built into AudaSpace at that time.

These nodes are VERY Experimental! Expect some issues as of 30/05/2019.

They require Objects and Collections as shown in the base-daw.blend file available from the top level of this branch - to be loaded where you like, but your Blender "addons" folder is a good place to start:

../Application Support/Blender/2.8/scripts/addons/daw

This also contains the base setup nodes. There is very little help for these at the moment, but this will follow. In the meantime, contact me for advice. It is important that the Collections are maintained and that their names are NOT changed. Add new collections for tracks, then copy the notes you need to these collections and edit away. If you need a sample blend file to work with, contact me and I will provide one.

Please provide any feedback, including issues via the "Issues" option, or by mail, if you want to remain anonymous. Using the "Issues" option is preferred as others can then read replies and benefit from shared knowledge!

Cheers, Clock.
